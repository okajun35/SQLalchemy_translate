"A quick way to add a \"validation\" routine to an attribute is to use the"
" :func:`~sqlalchemy.orm.validates` decorator. An attribute validator can "
"raise an exception, halting the process of mutating the attribute's "
"value, or can change the given value into something different. "
"Validators, like all attribute extensions, are only called by normal "
"userland code; they are not issued when the ORM is populating the "
"object::"

"The validation function by default does not get emitted for collection "
"remove events, as the typical expectation is that a value being discarded"
" doesn't require validation.  However, :func:`.validates` supports "
"reception of these events by specifying ``include_removes=True`` to the "
"decorator.  When this flag is set, the validation function must receive "
"an additional boolean argument which if ``True`` indicates that the "
"operation is a removal::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/mapped_attributes.rst:76
msgid ""
"The case where mutually dependent validators are linked via a backref can"
" also be tailored, using the ``include_backrefs=False`` option; this "
"option, when set to ``False``, prevents a validation function from "
"emitting if the event occurs as a result of a backref::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/mapped_attributes.rst:93
msgid ""
"Above, if we were to assign to ``Address.user`` as in ``some_address.user"

"emitted, even though an append occurs to ``some_user.addresses`` - the "
"event is caused by a backref."

msgid "Using Descriptors and Hybrids"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/mapped_attributes.rst:109
msgid ""
"A more comprehensive way to produce modified behavior for an attribute is"
" to use :term:`descriptors`.  These are commonly used in Python using the"
" ``property()`` function. The standard SQLAlchemy technique for "
"descriptors is to create a plain descriptor, and to have it read/write "
"from a mapped attribute with a different name. Below we illustrate this "
"using Python 2.6-style properties::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/mapped_attributes.rst:134
msgid ""
"The approach above will work, but there's more we can add. While our "
"``EmailAddress`` object will shuttle the value through the ``email`` "
"descriptor and into the ``_email`` mapped attribute, the class level "
"``EmailAddress.email`` attribute does not have the usual expression "
"semantics usable with :class:`.Query`. To provide these, we instead use "
"the :mod:`~sqlalchemy.ext.hybrid` extension as follows::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/mapped_attributes.rst:158
msgid ""
"The ``.email`` attribute, in addition to providing getter/setter behavior"
" when we have an instance of ``EmailAddress``, also provides a SQL "
"expression when used at the class level, that is, from the "
"``EmailAddress`` class directly:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/mapped_attributes.rst:183
msgid ""
"The :class:`~.hybrid_property` also allows us to change the behavior of "
"the attribute, including defining separate behaviors when the attribute "
"is accessed at the instance level versus at the class/expression level, "
"using the :meth:`.hybrid_property.expression` modifier. Such as, if we "
"wanted to add a host name automatically, we might define two sets of "
"string manipulation logic::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/mapped_attributes.rst:218
msgid ""
"Above, accessing the ``email`` property of an instance of "
"``EmailAddress`` will return the value of the ``_email`` attribute, "
"removing or adding the hostname ``@example.com`` from the value. When we "
"query against the ``email`` attribute, a SQL function is rendered which "
"produces the same effect:"

"While the :func:`.synonym` is useful for simple mirroring, the use case "
"of augmenting attribute behavior with descriptors is better handled in "
"modern usage using the :ref:`hybrid attribute <mapper_hybrids>` feature, "
"which is more oriented towards Python descriptors.   Technically, a "
":func:`.synonym` can do everything that a :class:`.hybrid_property` can "
