"``associationproxy`` is used to create a read/write view of a target "
"attribute across a relationship.  It essentially conceals the usage of a "
"\"middle\" attribute between two endpoints, and can be used to cherry-"
"pick fields from a collection of related objects or to reduce the "
"verbosity of using the association object pattern.   Applied creatively, "
"the association proxy allows the construction of sophisticated "
"collections and dictionary views of virtually any geometry, persisted to "
"the database using standard, transparently configured relational "
"patterns."
