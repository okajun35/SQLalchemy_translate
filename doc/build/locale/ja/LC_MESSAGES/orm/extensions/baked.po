"``baked`` provides an alternative creational pattern for "
":class:`~.query.Query` objects, which allows for caching of the object's "
"construction and string-compilation steps.  This means that for a "
"particular :class:`~.query.Query` building scenario that is used more "
"than once, all of the Python function invocation involved in building the"
" query from its initial construction up through generating a SQL string "
"will only occur **once**, rather than for each time that query is built "
"up and executed."

"The rationale for this system is to greatly reduce Python interpreter "
"overhead for everything that occurs **before the SQL is emitted**. The "

"or cache the **return results** from the database.  A technique that "
"demonstrates the caching of the SQL calls and result sets themselves is "

"Usage of the baked system starts by producing a so-called \"bakery\", "
"which represents storage for a particular series of query objects::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:45
msgid ""
"The above \"bakery\" will store cached data in an LRU cache that defaults"
" to 200 elements, noting that an ORM query will typically contain one "
"entry for the ORM query as invoked, as well as one entry per database "
"dialect for the SQL string."

"The bakery allows us to build up a :class:`~.query.Query` object by "
"specifying its construction as a series of Python callables, which are "
"typically lambdas. For succinct usage, it overrides the ``+=`` operator "
"so that a typical query build-up looks like the following::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:71
msgid "Following are some observations about the above code:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:73
msgid ""
"The ``baked_query`` object is an instance of :class:`.BakedQuery`.  This "
"object is essentially the \"builder\" for a real orm "
":class:`~.query.Query` object, but it is not itself the *actual* "
":class:`~.query.Query` object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:78
msgid ""
"The actual :class:`~.query.Query` object is not built at all, until the "
"very end of the function when :meth:`.Result.all` is called."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:81
msgid ""
"The steps that are added to the ``baked_query`` object are all expressed "
"as Python functions,  typically lambdas.  The first lambda given to the "
":func:`.bakery` function receives a :class:`.Session` as its argument.  "
"The remaining lambdas each receive a :class:`~.query.Query` as their "
"argument."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:87
msgid ""
"In the above code, even though our application may call upon "
"``search_for_user()`` many times, and even though within each invocation "
"we build up an entirely new :class:`.BakedQuery` object, *all of the "
"lambdas are only called once*.   Each lambda is **never** called a second"
" time for as long as this query is cached in the bakery."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:93
msgid ""
"The caching is achieved by storing references to the **lambda objects "
"themselves** in order to formulate a cache key; that is, the fact that "
"the Python interpreter assigns an in-Python identity to these functions "
"is what determines how to identify the query on successive runs. For "
"those invocations of ``search_for_user()`` where the ``email`` parameter "
"is specified, the callable ``lambda q: q.filter(User.email == "
"bindparam('email'))`` will be part of the cache key that's retrieved; "
"when ``email`` is ``None``, this callable is not part of the cache key."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:102
msgid ""
"Because the lambdas are all called only once, it is essential that no "
"variables which may change across calls are referenced **within** the "
"lambdas; instead, assuming these are values to be bound into the SQL "
"string, we use :func:`.bindparam` to construct named parameters, where we"
" apply their actual values later using :meth:`.Result.params`."

"The baked query probably looks a little odd, a little bit awkward and a "
"little bit verbose.   However, the savings in Python performance for a "
"query which is invoked lots of times in an application are very dramatic."
"   The example suite ``short_selects`` demonstrated in "
":ref:`examples_performance` illustrates a comparison of queries which "
"each return only one row, such as the following regular query::"

"Note that this test very intentionally features queries that only return "

"the baked query will have less and less of an impact, proportional to the"
" time spent fetching rows. It is critical to keep in mind that the "
"**baked query feature only applies to building the query itself, not the "
"fetching of results**.  Using the baked feature is by no means a "
"guarantee to a much faster application; it is only a potentially useful "

msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:169
msgid ""
"The \"lambda\" approach above is a superset of what would be a more "
"traditional \"parameterized\" approach.   Suppose we wished to build a "
"simple system where we build a :class:`~.query.Query` just once, then "
"store it in a dictionary for re-use.   This is possible right now by just"
" building up the query, and removing its :class:`.Session` by calling "
"``my_cached_query = query.with_session(None)``::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:187
#, python-format
msgid ""
"The above approach gets us a very minimal performance benefit. By re-"
"using a :class:`~.query.Query`, we save on the Python work within the "
"``session.query(Model)`` constructor as well as calling upon "
"``filter(Model.id == bindparam('id'))``, which will skip for us the "
"building up of the Core expression as well as sending it to "
":meth:`.Query.filter`. However, the approach still regenerates the full "
":class:`.Select` object every time when :meth:`.Query.all` is called and "
"additionally this brand new :class:`.Select` is sent off to the string "
"compilation step every time, which for a simple case like the above is "
"probably about 70% of the overhead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:198
msgid ""
"To reduce the additional overhead, we need some more specialized logic, "
"some way to memoize the construction of the select object and the "
"construction of the SQL.  There is an example of this on the wiki in the "
"section `BakedQuery "
"<https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/wiki/UsageRecipes/BakedQuery>`_,"
" a precursor to this feature, however in that system, we aren't caching "
"the *construction* of the query.  In order to remove all the overhead, we"
" need to cache both the construction of the query as well as the SQL "
"compilation.  Let's assume we adapted the recipe in this way and made "
"ourselves a method ``.bake()`` that pre-compiles the SQL for the query, "
"producing a new object that can be invoked with minimal overhead. Our "
"example becomes::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:222
msgid ""
"Above, we've fixed the performance situation, but we still have this "
"string cache key to deal with."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:225
msgid ""
"We can use the \"bakery\" approach to re-frame the above in a way that "
"looks less unusual than the \"building up lambdas\" approach, and more "
"like a simple improvement upon the simple \"reuse a query\" approach::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:238
#, python-format
msgid ""
"Above, we use the \"baked\" system in a manner that is very similar to "
"the simplistic \"cache a query\" system.  However, it uses two fewer "
"lines of code, does not need to manufacture a cache key of \"my_key\", "
"and also includes the same feature as our custom \"bake\" function that "
"caches 100% of the Python invocation work from the constructor of the "
"query, to the filter call, to the production of the :class:`.Select` "
"object, to the string compilation step."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:246
msgid ""
"From the above, if we ask ourselves, \"what if lookup needs to make "
"conditional decisions as to the structure of the query?\", this is where "
"hopefully it becomes apparent why \"baked\" is the way it is.   Instead "
"of a parameterized query building off from exactly one function (which is"
" how we thought baked might work originally), we can build it from *any "
"number* of functions.  Consider our naive example, if we needed to have "
"an additional clause in our query on a conditional basis::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:273
msgid ""
"Our \"simple\" parameterized system must now be tasked with generating "
"cache keys which take into account whether or not the "
"\"include_frobnizzle\" flag was passed, as the presence of this flag "
"means that the generated SQL would be entirely different.   It should be "
"apparent that as the complexity of query building goes up, the task of "
"caching these queries becomes burdensome very quickly.   We can convert "
"the above example into a direct use of \"bakery\" as follows::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:299
msgid ""
"Above, we again cache not just the query object but all the work it needs"
" to do in order to generate SQL.  We also no longer need to deal with "
"making sure we generate a cache key that accurately takes into account "
"all of the structural modifications we've made; this is now handled "
"automatically and without the chance of mistakes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:305
msgid ""
"This code sample is a few lines shorter than the naive example, removes "
"the need to deal with cache keys, and has the vast performance benefits "
"of the full so-called \"baked\" feature.  But still a little verbose!  "
"Hence we take methods like :meth:`.BakedQuery.add_criteria` and "
":meth:`.BakedQuery.with_criteria` and shorten them into operators, and "
"encourage (though certainly not require!) using simple lambdas, only as a"
" means to reduce verbosity::"

#: ../../orm/extensions/baked.rst:325
