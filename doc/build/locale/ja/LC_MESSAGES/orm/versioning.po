"The :class:`.Mapper` supports management of a :term:`version id column`, "
"which is a single table column that increments or otherwise updates its "
"value each time an ``UPDATE`` to the mapped table occurs.  This value is "
"checked each time the ORM emits an ``UPDATE`` or ``DELETE`` against the "
"row to ensure that the value held in memory matches the database value."

#: ../../orm/versioning.rst:14

"Because the versioning feature relies upon comparison of the **in "
"memory** record of an object, the feature only applies to the "
":meth:`.Session.flush` process, where the ORM flushes individual in-"
"memory rows to the database. It does **not** take effect when performing "
"a multirow UPDATE or DELETE using :meth:`.Query.update` or "
":meth:`.Query.delete` methods, as these methods only emit an UPDATE or "
"DELETE statement but otherwise do not have direct access to the contents "
"of those rows being affected."

"The purpose of this feature is to detect when two concurrent transactions"
" are modifying the same row at roughly the same time, or alternatively to"
" provide a guard against the usage of a \"stale\" row in a system that "
"might be re-using data from a previous transaction without refreshing "
"(e.g. if one sets ``expire_on_commit=False`` with a :class:`.Session`, it"
" is possible to re-use the data from a previous transaction)."

#: ../../orm/versioning.rst:31

"When detecting concurrent updates within transactions, it is typically "
"the case that the database's transaction isolation level is below the "
"level of :term:`repeatable read`; otherwise, the transaction will not be "
"exposed to a new row value created by a concurrent update which conflicts"
" with the locally updated value.  In this case, the SQLAlchemy versioning"
" feature will typically not be useful for in-transaction conflict "
"detection, though it still can be used for cross-transaction staleness "
"detection."

"The database that enforces repeatable reads will typically either have "
"locked the target row against a concurrent update, or is employing some "
"form of multi version concurrency control such that it will emit an error"
" when the transaction is committed.  SQLAlchemy's version_id_col is an "
"alternative which allows version tracking to occur for specific tables "
"within a transaction that otherwise might not have this isolation level "
"set."

"Above, the ``User`` mapping tracks integer versions using the column "

"of the table later on will always be emitted in a manner similar to the "
"following::"
msgstr ""

"The above UPDATE statement is updating the row that not only matches "
"``user.id = 1``, it also is requiring that ``user.version_id = 1``, where"
" \"1\" is the last version identifier we've been known to use on this "
"object. If a transaction elsewhere has modified the row independently, "
"this version id will no longer match, and the UPDATE statement will "
"report that no rows matched; this is the condition that SQLAlchemy tests,"
" that exactly one row matched our UPDATE (or DELETE) statement.  If zero "
"rows match, that indicates our version of the data is stale, and a "
":exc:`.StaleDataError` is raised."

"Other kinds of values or counters can be used for versioning.  Common "
"types include dates and GUIDs.   When using an alternate type or counter "
"scheme, SQLAlchemy provides a hook for this scheme using the "
"``version_id_generator`` argument, which accepts a version generation "
"callable.  This callable is passed the value of the current known "
"version, and is expected to return the subsequent version."

"The persistence engine will call upon ``uuid.uuid4()`` each time a "
"``User`` object is subject to an INSERT or an UPDATE.  In this case, our "
"version generation function can disregard the incoming value of "
"``version``, as the ``uuid4()`` function generates identifiers without "
"any prerequisite value.  If we were using a sequential versioning scheme "
"such as numeric or a special character system, we could make use of the "

"The ``version_id_generator`` can also be configured to rely upon a value "
"that is generated by the database.  In this case, the database would need"
" some means of generating new identifiers when a row is subject to an "
"INSERT as well as with an UPDATE.   For the UPDATE case, typically an "
"update trigger is needed, unless the database in question supports some "
"other native version identifier.  The PostgreSQL database in particular "
"supports a system column called `xmin "
"<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/ddl-system-columns.html>`_ "
"which provides UPDATE versioning.  We can make use of the PostgreSQL "
"``xmin`` column to version our ``User`` class as follows::"

"generated values when it emits an INSERT or UPDATE, instead leaving these"
" columns as \"expired\" and to be fetched when they are next accessed, "

" a server side version column is used, the ORM needs to actively fetch "
"the newly generated value.  This is so that the version counter is set up"
" *before* any concurrent transaction may update it again.   This fetching"
" is also best done simultaneously within the INSERT or UPDATE statement "
"using :term:`RETURNING`, otherwise if emitting a SELECT statement "
"afterwards, there is still a potential race condition where the version "
