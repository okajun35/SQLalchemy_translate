"possible.  The ``inherits`` mapper keyword argument is not needed as "
"declarative will determine this from the class itself.   The various "
"\"polymorphic\" keyword arguments are specified using "
"``__mapper_args__``."

"other single or joined inheriting classes using the "

"In a situation like this, Declarative can't be sure of the intent, "

"assigning the same column. If the mapping is mis-configured such that the"
" ``start_date`` column is accidentally re-assigned to a different table "
"(such as, if we changed ``Manager`` to be joined inheritance without "
