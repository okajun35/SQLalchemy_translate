    Added "like" based operators as "comparison" operators, including
    :meth:`.ColumnOperators.startswith` :meth:`.ColumnOperators.endswith`
    :meth:`.ColumnOperators.ilike` :meth:`.ColumnOperators.notilike` among many
    others, so that all of these operators can be the basis for an ORM
    "primaryjoin" condition.
