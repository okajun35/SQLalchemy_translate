   Reworked :class:`.AssociationProxy` to store state that's specific to a
   parent class in a separate object, so that a single
   :class:`.AssocationProxy` can serve for multiple parent classes, as is
   intrinsic to inheritance, without any ambiguity in the state returned by it.
   A new method :meth:`.AssociationProxy.for_class` is added to allow
   inspection of class-specific state.
