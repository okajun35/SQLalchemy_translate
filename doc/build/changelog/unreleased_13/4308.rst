	Fixed multiple issues regarding de-association of scalar objects with the
	association proxy.  ``del`` now works, and additionally a new flag
	:paramref:`.AssociationProxy.cascade_scalar_deletes` is added, which when
	set to True indicates that setting a scalar attribute to ``None`` or
	deleting via ``del`` will also set the source association to ``None``.
