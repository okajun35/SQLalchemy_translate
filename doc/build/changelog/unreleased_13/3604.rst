   Removed the collection converter used by the :class:`.MappedCollection`
   class. This converter was used only to assert that the incoming dictionary
   keys matched that of their corresponding objects, and only during a bulk set
   operation.  The converter can interfere with a custom validator or
   :meth:`.AttributeEvents.bulk_replace` listener that wants to convert
   incoming values further.  The ``TypeError`` which would be raised by this
   converter when an incoming key didn't match the value is removed; incoming
   values during a bulk assignment will be keyed to their value-generated key,
   and not the key that's explicitly present in the dictionary.

   Overall, @converter is superseded by the
   :meth:`.AttributeEvents.bulk_replace` event handler added as part of
   :ticket:`3896`.
