    Fixed issue with :meth:`.TypeEngine.bind_expression` and
    :meth:`.TypeEngine.column_expression` methods where these methods would not
    work if the target type were part of a :class:`.Variant`, or other target
    type of a :class:`.TypeDecorator`.  Additionally, the SQL compiler now
    calls upon the dialect-level implementation when it renders these methods
    so that dialects can now provide for SQL-level processing for built-in
    types.
