   Added new "lifo" mode to :class:`.QueuePool`, typically enabled by setting
   the flag :paramref:`.create_engine.pool_use_lifo` to True.   "lifo" mode
   means the same connection just checked in will be the first to be checked
   out again, allowing excess connections to be cleaned up from the server
   side during periods of the pool being only partially utilized.  Pull request
