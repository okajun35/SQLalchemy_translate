    :tickets: 4133

    Fixed bug where declarative would not update the state of the
    :class:`.Mapper` as far as what attributes were present, when additional
    attributes were added or removed after the mapper attribute collections had
    already been called and memoized.  Addtionally, a ``NotImplementedError``
    is now raised if a fully mapped attribute (e.g. column, relationship, etc.)
    is deleted from a class that is currently mapped, since the mapper will not
    function correctly if the attribute has been removed.
