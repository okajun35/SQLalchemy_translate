    :tags: feature, sql
    :tickets: 4271

    Added new logic to the "expanding IN" bound parameter feature whereby if
    the given list is empty, a special "empty set" expression that is specific
    to different backends is generated, thus allowing IN expressions to be
    fully dynamic including empty IN expressions.
