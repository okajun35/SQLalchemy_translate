    The ORM now doubles the "FOR UPDATE" clause within the subquery that
    renders in conjunction with joined eager loading in some cases, as it has
    been observed that MySQL does not lock the rows from a subquery.   This
    means the query renders with two FOR UPDATE clauses; note that on some
    backends such as Oracle, FOR UPDATE clauses on subqueries are silently
    ignored since they are unnecessary.  Additionally, in the case of the "OF"
    clause used primarily with Postgresql, the FOR UPDATE is rendered only on
    the inner subquery when this is used so that the selectable can be targeted
    to the table within the SELECT statement.
