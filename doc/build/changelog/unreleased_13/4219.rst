    Support added for the "WITH PARSER" syntax of CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX
    in MySQL, using the ``mysql_with_parser`` keyword argument.  Reflection
    is also supported, which accommodates MySQL's special comment format
    for reporting on this option as well.  Additionally, the "FULLTEXT" and
    "SPATIAL" index prefixes are now reflected back into the ``mysql_prefix``
    index option.
