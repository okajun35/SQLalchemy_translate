    The long-standing behavior of the association proxy collection maintaining
    only a weak reference to the parent object is reverted; the proxy will now
    maintain a strong reference to the parent for as long as the proxy
    collection itself is also in memory, eliminating the "stale association
    proxy" error. This change is being made on an experimental basis to see if
    any use cases arise where it causes side effects.
