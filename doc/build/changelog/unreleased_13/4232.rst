    An informative exception is re-raised when a primary key value is not
    sortable in Python during an ORM flush under Python 3, such as an ``Enum``
    that has no ``__lt__()`` method; normally Python 3 raises a ``TypeError``
    in this case.   The flush process sorts persistent objects by primary key
    in Python so the values must be sortable.
