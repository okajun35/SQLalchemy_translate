    Fixed long-standing issue in :class:`.Query` where a scalar subquery such
    as produced by :meth:`.Query.exists`, :meth:`.Query.as_scalar` and other
    derivations from :attr:`.Query.statement` would not correctly be adapted
    when used in a new :class:`.Query` that required entity adaptation, such as
    when the query were turned into a union, or a from_self(), etc. The change
    removes the "no adaptation" annotation from the :func:`.select` object
    produced by the :attr:`.Query.statement` accessor.
