   Added a workaround for a MySQL bug #88718 introduced in the 8.0 series,
   where the reflection of a foreign key constraint is not reporting the
   correct case sensitivity for the referred column, leading to errors during
   use of the reflected constraint such as when using the automap extension.
   The workaround emits an additional query to the information_schema tables in
   order to retrieve the correct case sensitive name.
